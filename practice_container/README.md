# React Practice Container

This repo serves as the remote for my practice using React and docker. I'll be working through the book, [The Road to React](https://www.roadtoreact.com/) by Robin Wieruch to help reinforce the concepts I'll need for this class and hopefully in my professional working environment very soon.
